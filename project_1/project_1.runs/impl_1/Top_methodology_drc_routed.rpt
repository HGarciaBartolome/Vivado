The clock pin Inst_fmsElevator/current_state_reg[1]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#3 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin Inst_fmsElevator/current_state_reg[2]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#4 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin Inst_fmsElevator/current_state_reg[3]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#5 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin Inst_fmsElevator/current_state_reg[4]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell Inst_fmsElevator/DOORS_reg_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) Inst_fmsElevator/DOORS_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell Inst_fmsElevator/DOORS_reg_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) Inst_fmsElevator/DOORS_reg/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#3 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell Inst_fmsElevator/LED_EMER_reg_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) Inst_fmsElevator/LED_EMER_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>
